# I did both problems manually. Both problems took me like 10 minutes (not counting in breakfast and coffeetime). The first one on my phone, the second in excel
# The second problem looked a lot harder as there could be quite a lot more steps. However, when taking into account that you 
# want to move the D's the least, then the C's etc. It was not very hard to solve. I'm not sure if I was just lucky with the orders
# Especially because the number 1 solved it in 23 minutes. Well, I cant prove my solving times right..?
